# VisAC
<h3>An interactive tool for <b>Vis</b>ual <b>A</b>nalysis of <b>C</b>onsanguinity in the ancestry of individuals</h3>

We have been working on visualization designs to support genealogy research (see our <a href="https://revealinginformation.blogspot.com/p/visualizations-to-support-genealogy.html"> blog post </a> for a description of other works), and herein we share the tool described in a paper published in the Information Visualization journal. 

The VisAC tool is implemented in R, ggplot2, and Shiny. Below, we show an image obtained with the tool representing the six generations' ancestors tree for Charles II of Spain and his second wife Marie Louise, highlighting their co-ancestry.
