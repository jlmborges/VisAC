<h3>An interactive tool for <b>Vis</b>ual <b>A</b>nalysis of <b>C</b>onsanguinity in the ancestry of individuals</h3>

We have been working on visualization designs to support genealogy research (see our <a href="https://revealinginformation.blogspot.com/p/visualizations-to-support-genealogy.html"> blog post </a> for a description of other works), and herein we share the tool described in a paper published in the Information Visualization journal. 

The VisAC tool is implemented in R, ggplot2, and Shiny. 

Below, we show an image obtained with the tool representing the six generations' ancestors tree for Elizabeth II, Queen of the United Kingdom, and Juan Carlos I, who was King of Spain until 2014. The plot shows that they are third cousins as they both descend from Queen Victoria, who was their great-great-grandmother.

A more complex example is given by Charles II of Spain and his second wife Marie Louise, who had a much higher level of consanguinity in their ancestry.
